# Deep-sparse-denoisig-with-DNN
R Code:

 Deep Sparse + Denoising Auto-encoder with standard deep neural network for detecting attack in the cyber-physical control loop in industrial IoT.   


 
How this model works: 

It is clearly explained in this paper 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333324742_An_Efficient_Intrusion_Detection_Model_for_Edge_System_in_Brownfield_Industrial_Internet_of_Things

How can use it:  

You can use it to test what you like or need. It may work for any dataset and any filed. Just try and tune it to fit your demand.
